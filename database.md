### E-Commerce REST API - Database Design

---

Our API uses **PostgreSQL** as its primary data store. We manage schema migrations and ORM with **Prisma**. Additionally, we use **Redis** for caching and **Amazon S3** for image storage. For a detailed view of the database schema, see the [dbdocs](https://dbdocs.io/irokovictor7/E-commerce-api).
